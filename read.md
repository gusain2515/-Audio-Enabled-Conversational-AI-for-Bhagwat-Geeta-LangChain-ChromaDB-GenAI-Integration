# Voice-Enabled Conversational AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
Overview
Purpose: Provide context-aware answers using a hybrid approach (pre-defined knowledge + generative AI) with voice interaction.

Target Audience: Developers, AI enthusiasts, and researchers interested in conversational AI systems.

Key Technologies:

Python, Hugging Face Transformers, ChromaDB

SpeechRecognition, gTTS, Wikipedia API

Models: deepset/roberta-base-squad2, google/flan-t5-large

âœ¨ Features
Real-Time Speech-to-Text with microphone input

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using ChromaDB vector storage

Fallback Mechanism to FLAN-T5 generative model when context is missing

Intent Detection for structured actions (e.g., appointment booking)

Conversation History tracking with vector embeddings

Text-to-Speech responses with auto-cleanup
